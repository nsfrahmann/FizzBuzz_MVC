# FizzBuzz_MVC
 This is my first attempt at using c# in the MVC instead of javascript to solve the FizzBuzz coding challenge.

## Description
Upon navigating over to the Solve Page, there is a basic ui layout that allows you to enter two inputs and fully executes the FizzBuzz challenge by printing the numbers 1~100 while substituting "Fizz" for numbers divisible by first input and "Buzz" for numbers divisible by second input and "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both. To see another example of this you can check my FizzBuzz mini-site [here](//nates-fizzbuzz-solution.netlify.app).
